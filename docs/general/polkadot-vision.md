## A Multi-chain Future

Since the release of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain projects increased exponentially to the order of
tens of thousands. Different projects have different value propositions, suggesting that the future
will likely be multi-chain, and that inter-chain communication will be crucial to establish
collaborations and leverage each other strengths.

## Polkadot 1.0

Polkadot 1.0 is a Layer-0 blockchain that brings to the multi-chain vision the following innovative
concepts and initiatives:

- **Application-specific Layer-1 blockchains (or parachains).** Polkadot is a sharded network where
  data are processed in parallel within each shard. Unlike Ethereum shards, Polkadot shards can be
  heterogenous (i.e. they do not need to be the exact copy of the original shards). This allows to
  build L1 chains that are specifically designed around their application and value proposition.
- **Shared security and financial scalability of L1 chains**. Any L1 chain attached to a Polkadot
  core (and any other L2 solution to scale that L1) will benefit from Polkadot shared security
  model. This means that the Polkadot NPoS mechanism will secure L1 and L2 chains without worrying
  about proof-of-stake.
- **Secure interoperability.** Any L1 chain attached to a Polkadot core will benefit from Polkadot's
  native interoperability, and will thus be able to communicate and exchange value and information
  with other parachains.
- **Truly unstoppable infrastructure.** This is achieved through on-chain treasury funds that can be
  accessed through governance referendum. Those funds guarantee constant sponsorship for events,
  initiatives, educational material, software development, etc., without any central entity being
  able to interfere.
- **Fast deployment of L1 chains.** This is achieved through the modular and flexible
  [Polkadot SDK Substrate](./glossary.md#substrate).
- **Fostering next-gen of web3 core developers.** This is achieved through different initiatives
  such as:
  - [The Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.network/development/academy/)
  - [Substrate Builders Program](./builders-program.md)
  - [Polkadot Developer Heroes Program](./dev-heroes.md)
  - [Edx Courses](https://www.edx.org/school/web3x)
  - Rust and Substrate Courses (coming soon)

The Polkadot relay-chain also manges [crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md),
[auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md), [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md),
[accounts](./learn-accounts-index), [balances](../learn/learn-balance-transfers.md), and
[governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md). Parachain slots or cores are leased in 6-month
chunks for a maximum of two years, and crowdloans allow users to trustlessly loan funds to teams for
lease deposits in exchange for pre-sale tokens. There is no other way you could use Polkadot 1.0.

The Polkadot realy-chain has been represented as a central ring surrounded by multiple parachains
attached its cores. Parachains can communicate with each other using a ubiquitous
[cross-chain messaging format (XCM)](./learn-xcm-index).

But, as with many other projects before Polkadot across different fields, at some point in time
after achieving the initially-planned goals, a perspective shift allows you to better understand
what your project is about and what you actually have built. This allows you to "run the extra mile"
and achieve more than what it was originally planned.

The quote below by [Marcel Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust) must remind us that
sometimes a perspective shift is crucial in understanding the world and perhaps it is more important
than seeing more of the world.

_The only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of Eternal Youth, would be not to visit
strange lands but to possess other eyes._

Thus, if we start to see Polkadot with _other eyes_ we can truly envision its potential and what it
could become.
