## A Multi-chain Future

Since the release of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain projects increased exponentially to the order of
tens of thousands. Different projects have different value propositions, suggesting that the future
will likely be multi-chain.

## Polkadot 1.0

Polkadot 1.0 is a Layer-0) blockchain aiming to provide secure interoperability and shared security
to other Layer-1 blockchains (or parachains). It also manges
[crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md), [auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md),
[staking](../learn/learn-staking.md), [accounts](./learn-accounts-index),
[balances](../learn/learn-balance-transfers.md), and
[governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md). Parachain slots or cores are leased in 6-month
chunks for a maximum of two years, and crowdloans allow users to trustlessly loan funds to teams for
lease deposits in exchange for pre-sale tokens. There is no other way you could use Polkadot 1.0.

The Polkadot realy-chain has been represented as a central ring surrounded by multiple parachains
attached its cores. Parachains can communicate with each other using a ubiquitous
[cross-chain messaging format (XCM)](./learn-xcm-index).

But as with many projects across different fields before Polkadot, at some point in time, after
achieving the goals initially planned at launch, a perspective shift allows you to better understand
what your project is about, run the extra mile, and achieve more than what was planned at the
inception.

The quote below by Marcel Proust must remind us that sometimes a perspective shift is crucial in
understanding the world and perhaps more important than seeing more of the world.

_The only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of Eternal Youth, would be not to visit
strange lands but to possess other eyes._

Thus, if we start to see Polkadot with _other eyes_ we can truly envision its potential and what it
could become.
